# Welcome to the Glass Controller
Firstly, welcome to the Glass Controller!
While you might feel a little anxious getting to know everyone around here. Don’t worry, most of the time we don’t bite. However, in order to make your life a little easier in terms of finding your feet. Here are some things to keep in mind while you’re here.

# House Keeping 101
- There are a few basic rules for Glass Controller :
- You can’t leave #general - not our choice! But something to keep in mind
- Remember to toggle your notifications - particularly if you use more then one slack, you can find more information on how to do this on https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606-Using-Slack
- We have disabled @here, @anyone & @channel. People have found it to be more annoying than helpful.
- Be nice to the admins, we’re all volunteers here. If we come to you when you notice a problem, please understand we’re only trying to help. Some of us have full time jobs as well, so might not be able to respond immediately.
- Equally, always ask questions to an admin if you’re unsure about anything.

# A few things to note:
- The Glass Controller is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, work, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or have membership revoked at the discretion of the organizers.
- GC is not a substitute for legal advice from a professional lawyer/barrister.
- GC should be considered SFW (Safe for Work). As a rule of thumb, before you post anything, consider if you’d want a co-worker or your boss to see it. While the admins are aware that GC is used by both professionals and vistors alike the tone shall be kept as SFW and to be used in a Social capacity until the community decides otherwise.

# The following is not allowed:
- Any content which is not in keeping with the Code of Conduct.
- Blatantly sexual content (pornography, nudity, etc.)
- Misogyny, ableism, sexism racism, nationalist insults etc.
- Personal abuse.
- Links to anything which would break the rules if posted directly.
- Posting any private phone numbers.
- Advocating criminality or violence.
- Trolling (A ‘troll’ is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory or off-topic messages with the primary intent of provoking other users. These users should be reported to admins immediately.)
- Posting libellous material.
- Misdirection or deceiving links (such as to sites which hijack the browser, rickroll, etc.).
- Anything illegal.
- Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the rights of others.
- Identify or speculate as to the identity of any pseudonymous user. The exception to this being Admins ruling out users who have already been banned using a different username
- Soliciting passwords or personally identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes
- Posting content in respect of any matter that is currently before the courts
- Posting Spam of any description.
- Posting or soliciting any members for anything outside of #selfpromo (when it’s to do with any product or service that you or your company are now producing/marketing). Posting job adverts for your company is also acceptable in #jobs.
- Posting or soliciting any members to contribute to or take part in any survey.
- Ignoring Admins requests to cooperate.
- Harassment
- Previously our rules stated that any breaches of the Terms of Service could be handled in any way that was fit by the admins. This could be either doing nothing about any alleged harassment or people could get banned. This lead to situations that ended up falling through the net and those issues always end up having their own sets of ramifications. Something the admin team have learned a lot about over the last 2 months.
- These new changes that we’ll be implementing are in effort to correct these instances and to avoid them happening ever again.
- Strikes
- GC will now work on a 3 strike system. All incidents will be recorded and the Admins will be keeping an up to date tally of people who are breaking ToS or generally having a negative attitude.
- An example of this; Anything that is blatant - linking to porn or NSFW material is a strike without question Harassment - is a strike Negative Attitudes - will be handled differently an example of this could be young people who needed to be guided into doing better. This will be handed by a DM with an admin who will approach the person in an attempt to guide. Should these words be unheeded a secondary strike will be applied.
- The team understands that not all strikes are equal; or there could be ways of reasoning out poor behaviour (being provoked etc) however, in an environment where you are expected to reason like adults. It’s something we’re no longer excusing.
- So, unfortunately, if this shoe fits then this is something to be aware of.

# In Channel Harassment:
On the terms of in channel harassment. Once again, approaching this in a fashion where we are all human beings who are worthy of respect and being treated civilly. That is what we will ultimately strive for. For the sake of consistency I’ll reiterate the general house rules.

# House Rules:

In all things we ask you to FOCUS.
Is it…
Friendly On-topic Clean Useful Safe
And if what you’re saying isn’t any of the above then you probably shouldn’t say it.

# In Channel Harassment
The admin in that instance will then work with the parties involved to come to a resolution on the subject. If harassment has been found it will be a strike and the offending party will be barred from communicating with that specific person. Should they reoffend it will be an instant ban.
For where they have been any misunderstandings happening the admin will help to resolve any miscommunications.
For those who are making claims about someone harassing them where they have not equal measures shall take place. Ie. they will be barred from communicating with that person and will be giving a strike. Breaking of this shall be an instant ban.

# Being Asked to Leave
There may come a point in time where a member of the community may be significantly impacting another members life either personally or professionally. So, things like abusing people on Twitter or there being a conflict of interest between members may result in you being asked to leave.
We want GC to be a safe and constructive space for everyone to be in. As the internet is a vibrant and expansive place there are plenty of other places for you to go to if you wish to engage in shitty behaviour.
Ultimately, Admins will have the say as to who stays and who goes. As the old saying goes; this is our bar and we decide who comes and goes. It’s the only way of providing some safeguards for people who have been less than honourable in their behaviours or conduct.
In an ideal world, people would act with honour and integrity to each other and generally just be kind. If you are incapable of doing that to each other. Then this is not a place for you and you will be asked to leave. The admins are under no obligation to elaborate on questions as to why certain members are gone. There has to be a level of trust that we are doing things with people’s best interests in mind, and if that trust isn’t there then this may apply to you too.
