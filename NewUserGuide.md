# Channels

Your Slack workspace is comprised of channels. You’ll use channels to hold most of your conversations with other members. They can be organized around anything — departments, projects, or even office locations — and you can create as many as you need. Every workspace starts with three channels by default:  #general #random and #introduction

# Direct messages 

When you need to quickly chat or check in with teammates, you can send them a direct message (DM). Direct messages are best for ad-hoc, quick discussions. These conversations are only visible to and searchable by you and the other members you DM. You can DM just one person, or start a group message with up to 8 other people.

# Sending messages

Communication in Slack happens through messages, whether they’re in channels or DMs. Most communication should happen in public channels to create a transparent and searchable archive of your team’s work. No matter where they’re shared, you can format your messages to help present your ideas. Did we mention emoji? Use them to enhance your own or to react to your teammates’ messages.

# Message threads

Threads let you respond directly to a message in a channel, keeping the replies organized neatly in a single, threaded conversation. Go ahead, ask questions and dig deeper, have side conversations, or go on a tangent without interrupting the flow of conversation.

*Why use threads?* 

- Encourage open discussion without distracting others.
- Organize conversations and preserve meaningful context. 
- Focus your time and attention on the task at hand.

*Start a thread to reply to a message*

- Hover over the message you'd like to reply to directly.
- Click the  reply icon. Or, click on any message with replies to view the thread in the details pane.
- Compose your message.
- Click Send. 

# Keep track of threads

*Follow a thread*

You’ll automatically follow a message when you add a reply to a thread. If you’re interested in the conversation but have nothing to add, follow the message to stay in the loop:

- Hover over a message or conversation you’d like to follow. 
- Click the   Show message actions icon.
- Select Follow thread from the menu to be notified about all new replies.

*Unfollow a thread* 

If you're not interested in new replies in a conversation, you can simply unfollow the thread:

- Open the All Threads view at the top of the channel list.
- Hover over the original message in the thread you'd like to unfollow. 
- Click the Show message actions icon.

# A guide to using threads
To thread or share a message? Threads work best when you want to keep your response connected to the original idea. Sharing a message is best used to rekindle past conversations or highlight specific messages from one channel to another. 
Avoid overuse. A thread's discussion won't appear in a channel's main view, so if other members would benefit from seeing your message, it's best to keep it out of a thread.
Threads are courteous. They help keep channels focused and prevent active discussions from becoming derailed. But if you want others to see your message in a thread, send it to the entire channel just like a regular message in Slack. 

Choose Unfollow thread from the menu.
